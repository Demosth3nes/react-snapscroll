# React-snapscroll

A colleague asked me if creating a horizontal scrollbar which snaps to the nearest selection was possible. I believed it was and therefore I decided to go ahead and try and create it, as I haven't seen it outside of an app. I started using es5/6 JS, then progressed to es6, and finally to a es6/React component. Its not completely finished but it is a nice prototype of what is possible in react and on mobile devices.
